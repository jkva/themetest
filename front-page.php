            <h2>Welcome to Tau Station</h2>

            <p>I&#39;m doing heater runs in Taungoo when a contact I haven&#39;t heard from in years asks me to quietly deliver a package to Nouveau Limoges, another station in the Sol System. The money&#39;s good so I head down to the port, hop in <em>Amethyst</em>, and launch. <em>Amethyst</em>&#39;s an older ship and she&#39;s higher maintenance than I&#39;d like, but she keeps flying.</p>

            <p>A little over 7 segments later (just over 1.5 hours, old Earth time) I arrive at Nouveau Limoges and that&#39;s when the trouble kicks in. I&#39;m a Consortium citizen, but Nouveau Limoges is a Gaule station and I forgot to renew my visa. Immigration computers notice my status and <em>Amethyst</em>&#39;s nav system is overridden to auto-deport me. Meanwhile, I was supposed to deliver the package in my hold within 8 segments and now it&#39;s starting to change shape. I think I&#39;ve been set up.</p>

                <p>Welcome to humanity&#39;s future, 189 AC (After Catastrophe). I know you want to ask what that means in Earth years, but we&#39;re not rightly sure. Most of what we knew was lost when the databanks were purged, as was the exact year. From survivors&hellip;</p>
